    <p class="explain">
    The wizard on the green background is my code for the start of a game. This is only a test game, so there won't be much.
    KappaPride Arcade resulted from the original idea: Cyberspace Arcade. By making a mess out of the first set of scripts from Cyberspace Arcade,
    we decided that it was easier to just start from scratch. The purpose of KappaPride Arcade was to relieve stress from American politics and Mr. Greek's 
    class. The code included four main sprites supported by smaller sprites that interact with the main sprites to allow the game to function correctly.
    One of the main sprites, JohnGreek, would receive a broadcast called difficulty.Hard at the start of the last round. He would then go to a specific x
    position and y position, show himself on the screen, set his health to 200, say a couple of lines, provides three different broadcasts, and
    glide back and forth in a loop until the hero health or his own health depletes to 0. To narrow it down, only one broadcast will be mentioned.
    JohnGreek's broadcast of Calculus.Shoot() will be sent to himself and two sprites called calculus and Hero. Once calculus receives Calculus.Shoot(), it
    will change its location to JohnGreek, show itself, and glides to a specific x position. This causes a straight projectile motion across the screen.
    This broadcast will be repeated until the hero health or JohnGreek's health is equal to or less than 0. Upon receiving the broadcast, Hero will check
    to see if it is touching the calculus sprite and will lose health upon contact. When hero health is equal to or less than 0, it will broadcast
    play.GameOver(). Once JohnGreek receives his own broadcast of Calculus.Shot(), he will check to see if he is touching the projectile that is being launched
    by Hero. The concept is the same as Hero's loop. The process will repeat until JohnGreek's health reaches 0 which will initiate his hidden status, a change
    in the variable Score and broadcast play.Victory(). As one may notice, all of these are basic loops cycling until an event triggers another broadcast.
    In an event of a problem, we would have to go through every sprite and look at the scripts to see which was inputting incorrectly. Most of the
    difficulties that we've encountered was due to the program being too STRICT on some blocks of scripts. A noticeable "issue" with our game was 
    when the KappaRainbow projectile became stuck for unknown reasons. With no luck on finding out the cause of this, we decided to turn this into the
    opportunity to make our game more challenging. We called this JohnGreek's little trick. It would be presented as if he had the ability
    to freeze projectiles in midair and "dodge" them as they passed through him. Overall, the game-making process from the program developed by
    scratch.mit.edu was fun and frustrating. May KappaPride Arcade live on to be the greatest game of all time!
